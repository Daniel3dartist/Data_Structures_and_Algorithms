# Data Structures and Algorithms
This repository aims to contribute to the community by helping those who have difficulty with data structures and algorithms to understand the topic.

NOTE: This project is still in the development and prototyping phase. Some instructions may be missing and it is possible that over time the project will go through major changes to restructure directories or similar.
